let gameName = "SpiderMan";
gameName = "SpiderMan 2"; // we can overwrite the value of a variable
console.log(gameName); // Output: SpiderMan 2
// const is used to reserve the memory location for a variable
const username = "Abhishek";
// username = "Abhishek Kumar"; // This will throw an error because we cannot reassign a value to a constant
// TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
console.log(username); // Output: Abhishek
// const is more used in the programming world , we want to have more reliability.
